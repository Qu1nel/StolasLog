      üëã Hello! Thanks for reaching out.

      For questions and support requests, we've found that **GitHub Discussions** is a much better platform. It allows the entire community to participate and benefit from the conversation.

      **We kindly ask you to post your question there instead:**

      ‚û°Ô∏è [**Ask a Question in GitHub Discussions**](https://github.com/Qu1nel/StolasLog/discussions/new?category=q-a)

      This helps us keep the issue tracker focused on bugs and feature requests. If you believe your question reveals a bug, please feel free to open a Bug Report instead!
